# Canadian trade

Why did Donald Trump start an unnecessary trade war with Canada? For no good reason, of courses. His justifications are all bullshit. Canada's contribution to the US border problem is negligeable, and the trade deficit with Canada is dwarfed by those of other US trade partners like China and Germany. [sources needed]

My pet theory is that he did not like being cuckholded by Justin Trudeau.

It goes back to a G7 summit in 2019 where a saucy photo of Trudeau kissing Melania went viral. One headline (from French news, of course) read, ["Look of Lust."](https://www.france24.com/en/20190827-papers-indonesia-names-new-capital-borneo-israel-lebanon-melania-trudeau-g7-photo).

The first daughter was not spared the Trudeau photo trap either. One viral tweet said, ["Get someone that looks at you the way Ivanka Trump looks at Justin Trudeau."](https://x.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/831280292379910144?t=EAPxWbPN6pyIdn-oeZOecQ&s=19)

As ridiculous (and hilarious) as all this is, we now have a trade war.

Mark Carney, who will replace Trudeau as Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, said after his election that [Canada "will win" the trade war.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkg47z1po.amp) Pierre Poilievre, leader of the main Conservatives opposition, also indicated [favoring a retaliatory response](https://youtube.com/shorts/4ZP7V5cxKPs?si=hMU9ef43AnjcC4nY) to US tariffs.

So how might this play out for Canadian industries and ? Let's first take a look at the current state of affairs between Canada and its main trade partners. Then we'll discuss how the proposed tariffs and counter-tariffs may influence Canada's trade patterns and the effect on jobs, wages, and prices.

TODO/might-dos:
* Descriptive figures of balance of payments by industry for Canada and main trade partners
* General equilibrium (SOE) model with tariffs
* DSGE (NOEM) model
