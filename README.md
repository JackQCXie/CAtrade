# Canadian trade

Why did Donald Trump start an unnecessary trade war with Canada? For no good reason, of courses. But my pet theory is that he hates being cuckholded by Justin Trudeau.

It all goes back to a G7 summit in 2019 where a saucy photo of Trudeau kissing Melania went viral. One headline (from French news, of course) read, ["Look of Lust."](https://www.france24.com/en/20190827-papers-indonesia-names-new-capital-borneo-israel-lebanon-melania-trudeau-g7-photo).

First daughter Ivanka Trump was not spared the Trudeau photo trap either. One viral tweet said, ["Get someone that looks at you the way Ivanka looks at Justin Trudeau."](https://x.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/831280292379910144?t=EAPxWbPN6pyIdn-oeZOecQ&s=19)

These memes are all ridiculous and hilarious, of course. And now we have a trade war.
